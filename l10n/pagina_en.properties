paginae/quest/eatdrink=All this shifting about has made you hungry, and your stomach growls to remind you that you should probably acquire some food and drink before you starve.

paginae/skills/ahusb=$i{"Harnessed by the Old Gods,\nThe Urox plowed across the skies,\nThe furrow of time."}\n\nYou have had enough close encounters with various beasts of the Wild Hearth that the thought of taming some of them has entered your mind. You may snare and keep tamable beasts, as well as construct coops, troughs, and hitching posts.\n\nTo tame a wild, tamable, animal: \nFirst, lure it to you with clover.\nThen snare it with a rope.\nThen tie it to a hitching post.\nThen, when soon it stands ready to fight,\nDefeat it in combat again, and again,\nBut when it yields to you, yield to it,\nAnd hurt it no further,\nUntil its beast has been quelled.
paginae/skills/archery=$i{"Where Alfthing fell,\nOn blood-wet grass,\nA broken arrow."}\n\nWith basic mastery of Archery you can draw and fire bows, fletch arrows, and sew quivers.
paginae/skills/artifice=$i{"The Great Clockwork of the Hearth,\nTells the time of all times,\nTicks the sun, moves the beast, draws forth the plants to eat."}\n\nYou have seen far beyond the mundane trivialities of petty craftsmanship, and your thoughts seek in all matters of artifice the eternal. You enjoy the greatest possible success when mining and forging wrought iron.
paginae/skills/baking=$i{"Rising slowly,\nLeavened with time,\nSweet as the ages."}\n\nSomething smells lovely, and you seem to know what. You've learned the basics of whipping up a good bread or pie.
paginae/skills/beekeeping=$i{"Golden Honey flowing,\nFrom flowerbeds and trees,\nThe sweetest things of nature,\nAre brought to us by bees."}\n\nOne hears a familiar buzzing around your parts these days. You have learned how to construct and maintain beehives.

paginae/skills/druidicrite = $i{"By the first moon of the solstice,\nEsthan brought swine to the Irminsul,\nThere hanging them for eight days,\nResting dead on soot-black branches."}\n\nYou have walked the dark wilds, and seen the moon rise over shallow graves where the mandrake weeps. You enjoy the greatest possible yields when farming, gardening, planting trees, and unraveling silk cocoons.
paginae/skills/farming=$i{"Watered by sweat there grew,\nGolden in Autumn, that Spring,\nWhere Winds did play and hide,\nIn sun-kissed Wheat and Barley."}\n\nYour hands lie heavy on plow and scythe, clawing in your palms the furrows of age and hard labor.

paginae/skills/fishing=$i{"The fathoms give nothing,\nYield not a single thing,\nBut to the fishermens' snares."}\n\nYou have mastered some basic fishing techniques, and can craft rods, poles, hooks, and lures.\n\nThere are two types of fishing: Rod and pole. Pole fishing uses various forms of live or fleshy bait -- such as earthworms, entrails, or ants -- whereas Rod fishing uses lures. Fishing poles catch fish immediatley whenever they bite, but the more demanding Rod fishing rather requries you to actually land the Fish by figuring out the many riddles of the sport. The truly rare fish of the world are caught with rods.
paginae/skills/forage=$i{"Full in her pride she stood,\nBlossoming through spring and autumn,\nWild with fruit and harvest-flowers."}\n\nYou know a thing or two about the wild plants of the land, and can see and pick a lot of them if you find them.

paginae/skills/forestry=$i{"Elfafnr nursed by the springs of Tain,\nThree Oaks for each of the Norns,\nTwo Linden trees for the Old,\nApples for himself."}\n\nYou care for the land and are able to do so. Through ardent study of the natural primacies you have developed an aptitude for treeplanting, and enjoy significantly greater success at it.

paginae/skills/gardening=$i{"Green and cool,\nWarm and welcoming,\nYour garden plot,\nAnd home."}\n\nYou enjoy gardening, and consequently gain significantly more seeds when farming.

paginae/skills/hunting=$i{"In a bloodred moment,\nThe beast fell still,\nGiving life through death."}\n\nFor what it's worth you have built up enough skill and courage to dare to attack, slay, dress, and prepare wild animals. Beware that some fell beasts of the wilds will kill and eat you, and that you might not be a competent enough fighter yet to take them on. Start out small, with Ants, and build your skills, before going for bigger prey.\n\nSome small animals, like Rabbits and Frogs, can be picked up without a fight, if you can catch them.
paginae/skills/jewelry=$i{"Timeless luster,\nAge and tradition,\nBeauty eternal."}\n\nYou have learned how to work with the precious metals, and other fine materials, of the Hearthlands, to make jewelry.
paginae/skills/lawspeaking = $i{"Where there was strife, let there be kinship.\nWhere there was hunger, let there be bread.\nWhere, yesteryear, pyres burned, let there be law."}\n\nThe Lawspeaker's position is held in high regard by traditional Hearthling society. His tasks vary with the seasons, but he is always called upon to perform his duties when disputes need to be settled, and when oaths be sworn or renewed. Having the Lawspeaking skill allows your character to found villages.

paginae/skills/oral = $i{"Of all the Ancients,\nMost among them saw Walwar,\nYet always spoke he the least."}\n\nThey say that the first stories were passed to the Hearthlings by the Old Gods. Some ancient things have always been known, and this is one of them.

paginae/skills/plantlore = $i{"Growing silently,\nFrom shadows everflowing,\nLight of greenery."}\n\nYou have begun developing a certain mastery of plant both wild and tame. You gain more seeds when farming, more produce when gardening, and you plant trees with greater success.
paginae/skills/pottery=$i{"Cracked, the potter's clay,\nPouring water, scraping dry,\nThe Vessel of Eternity.}\n\nYou've learned the art of making pots, cups and vases from clay. You can dig for clay in the shallows, and fire your produce in a Kiln.
paginae/skills/rage = $i{"Insults fell on his mind,\nLike sparks on wet leaves,\nUntil the leaves, one day, were dry.}\n\nYou've had quite enough, and someone is going to get it hard and fast. Rage allows you to initiate combat with other Hearthlings.\n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.
paginae/skills/ropetwin=$i{"One over one,\nHe drew round over round,\nTwinning rope from golden strands"}\n\nYou can construct and use a Rope Walk to stretch, twine, and tie ropes.
paginae/skills/sausagemaking=$i{"Crank of lever,\nPull of pork,\nSplit the bone,\nWield the fork."}\n\nYour mind has begun salivating at the prospect of turning red meat and casings into some of the most succulent, delightful, morsels imaginable.

paginae/skills/siege = $i{"Over land and bubbling brooks,\nWere brought to bear,\nStones, borne high by brimstone."}\n\nYou have acquired enough perfection in the art of destruction to begin contemplating the more offensive applications of it.

paginae/skills/silk=$i{"Ratjik's shirt was sewn,\nNot from fibre, nor hide,\nNot from animal, nor plant,\nWhat stuff made Ratjik's shirt?"}\n\nYou've been spending time among the mulberries, and have learned how to farm and handle silk. Breed Silkmoths, set their eggs on herbalist tables, feed the worms mulberry leaves, and unravel the cocoons.
paginae/skills/srv = $i{"Kodving broke the ice,\nSkarm drew him up,\nLogi saved them both."}\n\nThey say that the burning longings in the back of every Hearthling's mind are the ancient lores of Firemaking, and of Walking the Land & Wild. Any Hearthling who has passed through the Evergreen, and been burned into the world, knows how to build fire and shelter, provided she finds the right materials.
paginae/skills/steelmaking=$i{"Born in flame,\nYet cold and silent,\nThirsting for blood.\nWho am I?"}\n\nThe embers of your forge have run glowing red hot, and from them now spring the strangest, most wonderful materials.

paginae/skills/swim=$i{"Nine drops of rain-water,\nHe carried,\nOver land and black seas."}\n\nYou know how to get yourself out on deep water, which unfortunately carries with it the risk of never getting back alive to the shallows again.

Theft allows you to steal from claims and claim objects. \n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.
paginae/skills/tools = $i{"Fashioned alone,\nBy fire at night,\nWith fire in mind,\nThree Ashen staves."}\n\nThey say that some mysterious forms are eternal lodestars written into the firmament of the Hearth. You think you could make a Stone Axe for yourself if you found the right materials.
paginae/skills/tres=$i{"In the black of night,\nAlgaur found a hidden path,\nThrough the briar-patch,\nTo deep, and secret places."}\n\nYour feet have begun wandering to the strangest places, ending up where they really have no business of ending up.

paginae/skills/tunneling=$i{"Caroubdin, High King\nDemanded of his mountain realm,\nIn the third month of the Conflux,\nRed Gold, and Blue steel."}\n\nYou have begun getting to know the mountain, its ways and means, and its cruel, fickle whims. You may construct stone columns to support your mining operations, and you find better ores when mining.
paginae/skills/vandal = $i{"The Skarm was forded by the late solstice,\nThe Heiskarl brought two by six ships.\nThe city was sacked.}\n\nSomething deep inside of you has begun yearning to see the world burn. You may destroy objects, and otherwise perform deleterious actions, on claims, without permission. \n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.
paginae/skills/wheelwrighting=$i{"Creaking along,\nIn mud-swollen tracks,\nBut steady,\nAnd sturdy,\nTurns the Wheel of Seasons."}\n\nYou have figured out how to fashion a wheel for use in a cart, a wheelbarrow, or the like.
paginae/skills/winemaking=$i{"In autumn vineyards,\nDrunk with song and laughter,\nAnd bittersweet juice,\nRed with love and promise."}\n\nYou know a good vintage when you taste one, and also how to grow grapes and press them, to actually make wine. The secret? Ferment grape juice in demijohns, and store it in barrels.
paginae/skills/woodsmanship=$i{"In the depth of winter,\nLie hidden away,\nAlong secret trails,\nThe seeds of spring."}\n\nYou have walked the wilds for some time, and know your way around them. You have greater success when planting trees.
paginae/skills/wzm=$i{"Wicked portents,\nA black ash dripping with blood.\nAnd the entrails whisper\nOf lies and deceit."}\n\nYou have begun yearning for something... more. The Will to Power is the first step on the left-hand path of domination, and it is not without consequence.
paginae/skills/yeomanry=$i{"Kolbjorn first broke the land around the Veitvast,\nHis family now sits in unbroken line by that water,\nTheir Halls ringing with mead and laughter."}\n\nYou have made enough of an impact upon the world to begin thinking of some certain parts of it as being your own. You may construct Claim Poles, and begin claiming private plots of land around them.

paginae/wound/concussion=You remember that time you got knocked out cold? No, of course you don't, and therein lies the problem. You've faceplanted a few times too many, and are suffering as a result.\n\nThis wound will heal over time.
paginae/wound/crabcaressed = You've been in a real pinch, and this wound caused by the gentle caress of a crab still hurts a fair bit. It will probably heal over time, but does seem to linger for longer than you would perhaps have expected.\n\nDexterity: -3
paginae/wound/cruelincision = You have received a very dangerous cut that has very nearly severed a piece of you.

paginae/wound/somethingbroken = You have been badly traumatized, and something inside of you isn't quite as it should be.

paginae/wound/swollenbump=For some reason you have a large, sore, and swollen bump on you.

paginae/wound/unfaced=Your face has taken a good beating, but for some reason it doesn't bother you that much.
